In this project, I wanted to use the Memento pattern in my code. 
I was looking into the various types of design patterns and was 
most interested in the Memento pattern. The Memento pattern is a 
behavioral design pattern that stores the current and previous 
states of an object for future restoration. It is implemented 
such that the data of an object can only be accessed by the object 
itself. The Memento pattern does not create copies of the object. 
Instead, it creates “mementos” which hold the values of an object’s 
fields. I used this pattern to create a blog page with 3 sections: 

(1) the user’s name & hobbies, 
(2) website, and 
(3) personal statement. The blog page can also have a different 
background color. 

In this project, I wanted to save the text of all of the blog sections 
and the background color with ease, without having to create copies 
of every object.
